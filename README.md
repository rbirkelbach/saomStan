# saomStan

*This is under development and so far NOT useful at all.*

The goal of saomStan is to estimate stochastic actor oriented models of network change with rstan.

## Installation

You can install the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("rbirkelbach/saomStan")
```

Currently there's no released function as this is still a package skeleton.
